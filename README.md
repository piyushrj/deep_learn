This repo stores the code for the assignments in the course **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition** taught at **Stanford** and is consistent with the 2018 version of the course. Further details can be found here: [cs231n.github.io](https://cs231n.github.io)  
**IMPORTANT**  
The code particularly in the jupyter notebooks is written such that it would work on Google Colab since I didn't have enough compute on my local machine.
